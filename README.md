        <p>This is a page where I can upload futsal players' profiles from a HTML form with all their details such as: </p>
        <p>Name, Height, Weight and Age for example</p>
        <p>There's also a main page where you can check all the playeres registered</p>
        <p>It's quite a long shot for me as it's a project where I am developing both front and back end.</p>
        <p>The whole task became easier as I had dedicated a few days to study Spring Boot which is my best friend here</p>
        <p>The back end provides RESTful APIs which are then used on the front-end<p>
        <p>The whole application is persisted using MYSQL thanks to Spring Boot again</p>
        <p>I'm not too worried about the front-end design yet, because my focus now is to have a completely functional app first.</p>
        <p>Still loads to be done. Keep close!!!
